## Components of AWS Client VPN

### 1. **Client VPN Endpoint**
The Client VPN endpoint serves as the termination point for client VPN sessions. Administrators set up the endpoint and provide configuration files to users who connect to it. Once connected, users can securely access designated AWS and on-premises resources.

### 2. **Target Network**
The target network is the specific VPC subnet(s) linked to the Client VPN endpoint. This subnet enables users to connect to resources within the VPC. Associating multiple subnets in different Availability Zones enhances high availability for remote connections.

### 3. **Route**
Each Client VPN endpoint has a route table to define accessible network paths. For example, if a company has resources in different VPCs or AWS regions, the route table can include routes to those destinations, allowing users to navigate seamlessly.

### 4. **Authorization Rules**
Authorization rules control which users can access specific networks by integrating with Active Directory or an identity provider (IdP). For example, only users in the “Finance” Active Directory group may access specific financial applications on the network.

### 5. **Client**
The client is the end user connecting to the Client VPN endpoint. Users install an OpenVPN-compatible client application on their device and use a VPN configuration file to connect securely.

### 6. **Client CIDR Range**
The client CIDR range assigns a unique IP address to each connection from the specified IP range, like `10.2.0.0/16`. This range defines the IP addresses for all connected clients.

### 7. **Client VPN Ports**
AWS Client VPN supports ports **443** and **1194** for both TCP and UDP protocols. Typically, **443** is used for connections as it’s often open on firewalls, making it ideal for secure, consistent access.

### 8. **Client VPN Network Interfaces**
AWS Client VPN creates network interfaces in each associated subnet, which route VPN traffic to VPC resources. **Source Network Address Translation (SNAT)** converts client IP addresses from the client CIDR range into the IP address of the VPN network interface for internal routing.

### 9. **Connection Logging**
Enabling connection logging records details about client connections, allowing administrators to track activity, run security analysis, and troubleshoot connection issues.

### 10. **Self-service Portal**
AWS provides a self-service portal, a web page where end users can download the AWS VPN Desktop Client and the latest configuration file. The portal is globally available, so end users can quickly access the tools and configuration they need.

# AWS Client VPN: Rules and Best Practices

This document outlines the essential rules and recommended best practices for configuring and using AWS Client VPN. Adhering to these guidelines ensures optimal performance, security, and reliability when connecting to AWS resources via Client VPN.

---

## Key Rules for AWS Client VPN Usage

1. **Bandwidth Considerations**
   - Each user connection supports a minimum of 10 Mbps bandwidth.
   - Maximum bandwidth per user depends on the number of active connections to the Client VPN endpoint.

2. **Client CIDR Range Configuration**
   - **No Overlaps**: The Client CIDR range should not overlap with the CIDR range of the associated VPC subnet or any additional routes in the VPN’s route table.
   - **Range Size**: Client CIDR blocks should have a size between `/12` and `/22`.
   - **IP Allocation**: Some IP addresses within the Client CIDR range are reserved for availability and cannot be assigned to clients. Choose a CIDR range with double the required IPs for expected connections.
   - **Immutable Configuration**: Once a Client VPN endpoint is created, the Client CIDR range cannot be modified.

3. **Subnet Association**
   - All subnets associated with a Client VPN endpoint must belong to the same VPC.
   - Only one subnet per Availability Zone can be associated with a Client VPN endpoint.
   - **Limitations**: Dedicated tenancy VPCs do not support Client VPN subnet associations.

4. **IPv4 Only**
   - AWS Client VPN supports IPv4 traffic exclusively. For IPv6 traffic, consult AWS documentation on IPv6 considerations.

5. **DNS Name Usage**
   - **Avoid IP-based Connections**: Due to dynamic IP resolution, always connect to the Client VPN endpoint using the DNS name rather than an IP address.

6. **Self-Service Portal Limitations**
   - The self-service portal is unavailable for clients using mutual authentication methods.

7. **IP Forwarding Restrictions**
   - IP forwarding is not supported by the AWS Client VPN desktop application, though it is supported on other OpenVPN clients.

8. **AWS Managed Microsoft AD Region Constraints**
   - Ensure that the Client VPN endpoint and the AWS Managed Microsoft AD are located within the same AWS Region.

9. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - **Password Format Restriction**: If MFA is disabled, user passwords should avoid the format: `SCRV1:base64_encoded_string:base64_encoded_string`.

10. **Single User per Computer**
    - A VPN connection cannot be established from computers with multiple users logged in simultaneously.

---

## Security Recommendations

1. **Client LAN Address Ranges**
   - LAN IP address ranges on client devices should fall within the private IP address spaces: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, or `169.254.0.0/16`.
   - **Blocked Traffic**: If a client’s LAN falls outside of these ranges, the Client VPN endpoint will redirect LAN traffic to the VPN, mitigating the risk of local net attacks like TunnelCrack.

2. **Connection Integrity**
   - AWS Client VPN enforces that the IP connected by the client matches the IP resolved by the Client VPN endpoint’s DNS name. This requirement helps protect against IP-based attacks.

---


Following these rules and best practices for AWS Client VPN ensures robust and secure connections while maintaining compliance with AWS standards. Correctly configuring the Client VPN endpoint, client CIDR ranges, and subnet associations, along with adhering to the recommended security configurations, is essential to maximize performance and secure access to AWS resources.

- **Creating the Client VPN Endpoint:** Initiates the setup by establishing a VPN endpoint in AWS, which serves as the main access point for users.
  
- **Associating Target Network:** Connects the VPN endpoint to a subnet within the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) where resources are accessible.

- **Configuring Authorization Rules:** Defines access control rules, specifying which users can access specific resources.

- **Setting Up Routes:** Additional routing configurations enable access to on-premises networks or other AWS regions if needed.

- **Distributing VPN Configuration:** Downloads and provides the **Client VPN configuration file** to users. This file contains the DNS name and necessary authentication details for clients to securely connect to the VPN.

> For a detailed setup guide, refer to [Get Started with AWS Client VPN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/cvpn-getting-started.html).

### **2. Client Role**

The **client** is the end user who connects to the VPN endpoint to securely access the resources in AWS or on-premises networks:

- **Establishing a VPN Session:** Uses an OpenVPN-compatible client on their device, leveraging the VPN configuration file to establish a secure connection.

- **Accessing Resources:** Once connected, clients can securely interact with:
  - **AWS Resources:** Resources within the VPC subnet, such as EC2 instances, databases, or applications.
  - **On-premises Networks:** Access to on-premises resources is available when routing rules are configured.
  - **Other Clients or Services:** Clients may interact with additional resources based on the configured routes and permissions.
